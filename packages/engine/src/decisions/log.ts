            "Ties round upward, toward positive infinity — 14.5 becomes 15, and -14.5 becomes -14. This is JavaScript's Math.round, used directly rather than wrapped.",
        rationale:
            "Rounding half up is the ordinary tabletop reading of 'round to the nearest whole number' and favors the character, which is the right default for a value they are rolling with. It is worth recording because it is asymmetric across zero: a Derived Attribute CAN go negative once Conditions and injuries push the contributing Attributes below the stored 1-30 range, and at that point 'up' means 'smaller in magnitude' rather than 'better'. A GM comparing two heavily-penalized characters should know the tie-break is directional, not magnitude-based.",
